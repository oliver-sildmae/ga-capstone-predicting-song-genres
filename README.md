# GA Capstone project - Using song lyrics to predict genres
The aim of this project is to use solely the lyrics of songs to predict the genre/style to which they belong.

The data for this project comes from the below two auxiliary projects to The Million Song Dataset:  
Genres - http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/download.html  
Lyrics - https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch (bag-of-words format)

These two datasets were be merged, and various modelling techniques have been employed to try and make accurate genre predictions based on string input (lyrics).
