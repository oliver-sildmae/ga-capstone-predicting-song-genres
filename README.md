# GA Capstone project - Using song lyrics to predict genres
The aim of this project is to use solely the lyrics of songs to predict the genre/style to which they belong.

The data for this project comes from the below two auxiliary projects to The Million Song Dataset:  
Genres - http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/download.html  
Lyrics - https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch (bag-of-words format)

These two datasets were be merged, and various modelling techniques have been employed to try and make accurate genre predictions based on string input (lyrics).

If you want to put one of the final models to test, find some lyrics and head over to http://ec2-52-14-243-207.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ !
